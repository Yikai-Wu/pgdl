# Winning Solution of the NeurIPS 2020 Competition on Predicting Generalization in Deep Learning

We present various complexity measures that may be predictive of generalization in deep learning. The intention is to create intuitive and simple measures 
that can be applied post-hoc on any trained model to get a relative measure of its generalization ability.

Our solutions based on consistency, robustness, and separability of representations achieve the highest (22.92) and second-highest (13.93) scores 
on the final phase of the [NeurIPS Competitition on Predicting Generalization in Deep Learning](https://sites.google.com/view/pgdl2020/home?authuser=0). We are team interpex on the [leaderboard](https://sites.google.com/view/pgdl2020/leaderboard?authuser=0).
